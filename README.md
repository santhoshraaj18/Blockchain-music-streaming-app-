Welcome to the Blockchain Music Streaming App, a decentralized and blockchain-based music streaming application built using React technology and Solidity.

## Overview

The Blockchain Music Streaming App leverages the power of blockchain to provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized platform for music streaming. By combining React for the frontend and Solidity for the smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, we aim to revolutionize the music streaming industry.

## Features

- **Decentralized Architecture:** The app operates on a decentralized network, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of data manipulation.

- **Blockchain Technology:** Powered by Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, providing a secure and trustless environment.

- **React Frontend:** The user interface is built using React, offering a seamless and interactive experience for users.
